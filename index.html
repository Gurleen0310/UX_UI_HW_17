        <button>My Resume</button>
        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p2>Good design tells the right story relative to your mission and your brand. It strikes an emotional chord with your users that stands out as a competitive differentiator. In other words, a good design for your brand is one that adheres to your teamâ€™s design philosophy. A design philosophy is a step above your brand strategy and orients the team to aspirational goals so that every element of the customer experience is designed with clear intent.
</p2>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p3>I became interested in Design so I chose the direction of UX/UI, because I think it is practical and multifaceted than the web. I have studied and worked diligently in this area. Invested absolutely all the time in the design. Now I can say with confidence that I am a professional UX/UI designer.I started my UX/UI designer journey, by taking courses at University of Toronto where I learned the basics as well as worked on some techniques, and also read a lot of articles and literature about design.Of course, I am still learning new tricks and techniques in design, but everyone, even the most excellent professional, can learn.
